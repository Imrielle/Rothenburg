Granite needs a palette change. Its far too light and there isn't enough contrast with the other rock types

Stone: I'm a little unsure on the texture.
* Diorite palette is great
* Andesites is fine
* Base stone is pretty nice, too
* Granite was bad

Sea lanterns are broken

Grass needs to be lighter, and possibly needs its filler texture replaced. Its kind of flat

Sigh, water.

Misc Trees:
* Olive - spruce texture type
* Silverwood - Birch type
* Fir: Def use the spruce leaves

Leaves -
* Spruce: Looks fine
* Jungle: Oof.
* Oak: Ehhh
* Birch is kind of ehhhh
* Need to do BoP leaves still
