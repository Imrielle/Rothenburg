# Rothenburg
Rothenburg is a medieval inspired 32x32 resource pack for Minecraft, pixel-art style.

## About
Primarily, I started creating this because I couldn't find a pack that fit exactly what I wanted. I wanted something medieval themed, feature complete for the mods I use on my home server, and pixel art styled - that didn't make the original blocks unrecognizable.
John Smith mostly fits three out of four of that criteria (I actually used it for years), but isn't remotely a pixel art style, and it currently lacks support for quite a lot of the mods I use.

## Planned Mod Support
* Minecolonies (which makes sense, considering I'm one of their artists)
* Ancient Warfare 2, though erm. Theress some 900+ textures in their NPC skin pack.
* Quark and Charm
* End: Reborn - while this mod is slightly glitchy with its mob spawns... its End Stone and Purpur block additions are quite nice for building with.
* Biomes O' Plenty
* Thaumcraft 6
* Rustic
* Dark Roleplay Medieval. Maybe.
* Embers
* Roots 2
* Traverse - which shouldn't take long, considering
* Artisan Worktables - I'd love to see if I could make the models more unique. I'm not sure if its possible.

## Sources Folder
The sources folder contains raw files for the majority of the completed textures, most notably the stones and brick textures. These files are in the XCF format, which can be opened on any nealy any operating system using GIMP. Krita and Paint.net will also open these files. The majority of the layers for the different block textures are clearly named.

I've included them for two reasons - the first is so that if a user doesn't like a particular blocks color palette, its easier to open these files than it is to find and edit dozens of texture files.
The second reason is that I am a Linux user, and I tend to switch distros often, for various reasons. Having my own source files easily downloadable with a simple git pull is convienent, and also prevents the total loss of work I experienced in 2018.

## Current Status
This resource pack is still heavily a work-in-progress.

### Basegame
Roughly 63% of the base Minecraft blocks are textured, though several need re-working - especially the flowers.

### Mods
* Quark: Limestone and Marble started, some of the stones also started. Needs heavy reworking, they are based on textures I made about a year ago and no longer fit the pack style.
* Minecolonies: Semi-ashamed to admit that I haven't quite started to work on our blocks, because I'm very, very lazy. Also because my workflow has been Vanilla Blocks -> modded blocks generated in the world -> Ore Variants -> villagers -> everything else.
* Rustic: Slate textures 66% complete. I overlooked the Roof and Tile textures when I made them, somehow.
