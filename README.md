Medieval inspired 32x32 resource pack for Minecraft

## About

Primarily, I started creating this because I couldn't find a pack that fit exactly what I wanted. I wanted something medieval themed, feature complete for the mods I use on my home server, and pixel art styled - that didn't make the original blocks unrecognizable.
John Smith mostly fits three out of four of that criteria (I actually used it for years), but isn't remotely a pixel art style, and it currently lacks support for quite a lot of the mods I use.

Also, I wanted something to practice my pixel art skills on.

## Planned

* Chisel support
* Full Minecolonies support (which makes sense, considering I'm one of their artists)
* Full Millenaire and Ancient Warfare 2 support
* Botania support - though I'm not sure why I want to make that many flowers. I'm not particularly skilled at sprites.
* Thaumcraft 6 support
* Rustic Support

## Current Status
Pack is still heavily a work-in-progress.
### Basegame
Roughly 63% of the base Minecraft blocks are textured, though several need re-working - especially the flowers. Most have placeholder colors selected while I test them in various biomes.

Beds are also retextured, though they need some reworking on the wooden parts, and possible the coverlette texture edges. I'd like to see them look better placed side by side, and still look good singly.

### Mods
Admittedly, I started some of the below to procrastinate on the basegame sapling and crop textures. xD

* Chisel: Limestone and Marble started, some of the stones also started. Needs heavy reworking, they are based on textures I made about a year ago and no longer fit the pack style.
* Millenaire: 
* * Norman and Byzanz Male Nude skins mostly complete, clothing started.
* * Blocks started, bricks mainly complete.
* Minecolonies: Semi-ashamed to admit that I haven't quite started to work on our blocks, though thats because I'm currently working on new colonist models and skins for the actual mod, as well as a couple of items and... new furniture models and textures. There need to be 50 hours in a day.
* Rustic: Slate textures 66% complete. I overlooked the Roof and Tile textures when I made them, somehow.
* Immersive Engineering: While I don't exactly use this mod, I created basic textures for the ores, the stone Coke Oven and the stone Blast Furnace.
