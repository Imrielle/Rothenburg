* Finalized stone, granite, andesite palette.
  * Still need to adjust diorite palette.
  * Still need to finish off a few texture variations and adjust the stonebrick texture tilings. They tile well, just not where I want them to be.
  * Cobblestone needs still needs a facelift. Currently has the correct shapes, but needs a shading pass.
* Fixed up water textures, and lava.
  * Let there be lava!... ok, please let there not be lava. We don't want the world to burn... do we?
  * Now need to work on Magma.
* Added ore textures, and some textures for the "Ore Stone Variants" mod.
  * Still need moar textures for OSV, though.
  * Also might need to make adjustments to the ore palettes.
  * Also need to make modded ore textures for players who don't use this mod. Mostly forgot about that...
* Sand! Sand got an update, and a ConnectedTexturesMod texture for... wet sand. It looks wet next to water. Neat, right? Still needs variations, though.
* Purpur no longer murders the eyes. Now moar shiny.
* Netherrack and Nether bricks also look more better. Need to fix Quartz ore texture to match, though.
